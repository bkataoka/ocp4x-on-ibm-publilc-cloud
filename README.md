# OpenShift 4.3 on IBM Public Cloud

# Get Started

This GitHub project contains a set of prescriptive instructions for provisioning 
a bare metal host from the IBM Public Cloud, and installing OpenShift 4.x on it.

To use these intructions it is expected that this repository will be cloned to a
local machine.  On the local machine many of the files will be edited to update
installation specific details (like the URL of the host).  Once the files are edited
they are copied (via `scp`) from the local machine to the bare metal host.

The [Overview](overview.md) page outlines the overall steps and provides a starting 
point for installing OCP 4.x on IBM Public Cloud.
